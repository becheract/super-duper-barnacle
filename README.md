# Bechera

This library provides a Microsoft Makecode extension for the 4tronix MARS Rover

## Driving the MARS Rover
The simplest way to drive Rover is by using the `move_Milli(...)` and move(...)` blocks.
The speed is between 0 (stop) and 100 (full speed)
Direction can be Forward or Reverse   
```blocks
// Drive forward at speed 60
Rover.move(eVector.Forward, 60)

// Drive backwards at speed 70 for 2s
Rover.move_milli(eVector.Reverse, 70, 2000)

```   

You can also spin on the spot - either left or right   
```blocks
// Spin left at speed 60
Rover.spin(eDirection.Left, 60)

// Spin right at speed 50
Rover.spin(eDirection.Right, 50)
```

If you want more fine grain control of individal motors, use `Rover.motor(..)` to drive motor either forward or reverse. The value
indicates speed and is between `-1023` to `1023`. Minus indicates reverse.

```blocks
// Drive left motors forward at speed 60 (right motors are unchanged)
Rover.motor(eMotor.Left, eVector.Forward, 60)

// Drive both motors in reverse at speed 50
Rover.motor(eMotor.Both, eVector.Reverse, 50)
```

## Controlling the Servos

To turn an individual servo to a position from -90 to +90 degrees, use the setServo(..) command
```blocks
// Turn the Mast servo (servo 0) to 30 degrees
Rover.setServo(0, 30)

// You can also select the name of the servo using the getServoNumber(..) function.
// This command does the same as the one above
Rover.setServo(Rover.getServoNumber(eServos.Mast), 30)
```

To steer left, the front wheel servos need to point left and the rear servos to point right. You could do this  individually, but the Rover.steer(..) is designed for this
```blocks
// Turn the wheels to an angle of 30 degrees left. Motors are not affected.
Rover.steer(eDirection.Left, 30)

// Turn the wheels to an angle of 45 degrees right - Rather excessive turn!
Rover.steer(eDirection.Right, 45)

// To point straight ahead, you can either steer with an angle of zero, or simply centre the wheel servos:
Rover.zeroServos(eServoGroup.Wheel)
```

The MARS Rover has an EEROM that stores an offset for each servo to ensure that it points straight ahead when set to its zero position. You should run the CalibrateServos program to set these up for your robot after you first assemble it.
The servo offsets are stored in the Microbit memory when the Rover is started up. In the servo blocks you can set and clear the values in these offsets, but they will be lost when the Rover is switched off. You will need to use the commands in the EEROM blocks to save the values permanently.
```blocks
// To clear all the offsets in memory
Rover.clearOffsets()

// To set an individual servo offset to 8. Value from -128 to +127 (normally between -20 and +20)
Rover.setOffset(Rover.getServoNumber(eServos.FL), 8)
```

## Managing the EEROM

The EEROM on board the Rover stores the offsets for each servo to ensure that they are zero. However, there is plenty of room left, so it has been made acessible. You could store movement sequences, plan your daily journey, etc.
Each data value is an 8-bit integer, so it can have a value from -128 to +127. The EEROM is 1024 bytes, but the first 16 are used only for the servo offsets, so 1008 bytes are available for the user
```blocks
// To read a byte value from location 12 (in reality this is location 28) in a variable myValue
myValue = Rover.readEEROM(12)

// To write a value of 49 to location 12
Rover.writeEEROM(49, 12)
```

There are also blocks to manage the saving and loading of the servo offsets. These are treated as a single block of data, so all offsets are loaded or saved at the same time
```blocks
// Load all the stored offsets from EEROM into memory
Rover.loadOffsets()

// Save all the offsets from memory into the EEROM
Rover.saveOffsets()
```

## Read sonar value

If you have mounted the optional sonar sensor for the Robobit you can
also use the `robobit.sonar(..)` function to read the distance to obstacles.

```blocks
// Read sonar values
let distance = Rover.readSonar(ePingUnit.Centimeters);
```

## FireLed Functions

The MARS Rover has 4 FireLeds. One in each corner. There is a set of commands to control them

```blocks
// Set all FireLeds to Green (hard-coded RGB color)
Rover.setLedColor(0x00FF00)
// Set all FireLeds to Green (built-in colour selection)
Rover.setLedColor(eColors.Green)

// Clear all LEDs
Rover.ledClear()

// Set LED at position 2 (0 to 3) to Green
Rover.setPixelColor(2, Rover.eColours(eColors.Green))

// Set LEDs to a rainbow selection
Rover.ledRainbow()

// Set brightness of LEDs to 40 (0 to 255)
Rover.ledBrightness(40)
```
